// AI module — narration template library. Sprint 11 task 6.
//
// The Tier-A template library that drives the Daily Pulse narration
// line per docs/_reference/D14-ambient-ai-architecture.md §3.3.
// Sprint 11 ships the LIBRARY; Sprint 12.5 builds the GENERATOR that
// picks a template + substitutes slots. This file ships templates as
// data, voice-locked, with selectors that decide when each applies.
//
// Slot vocabulary:
//   {parent_label}      — "Mum" / "Dad" / "your parent" / "you"
//   {bp_value}          — e.g. "124/79"
//   {bp_week_avg}       — e.g. "121/77"
//   {bp_delta}          — small number, signed, e.g. "+6" or "-3"
//   {hr_resting}        — e.g. "62"
//   {sleep_total}       — e.g. "7h 24m"
//   {steps_today}       — e.g. "6,200"
//   {steps_target_hits} — e.g. "four days last week"
//
// Slots are filled by the Sprint-12.5 generator. The strings here
// must read clean even before substitution — voice-lint scans them
// with the same engine that gates Learn articles.
//
// Selector design:
//   - A NarrationContext describes the current vital-state tuple.
//   - Each template has `selector(context) → boolean` that returns
//     true when the template applies to the context.
//   - The Sprint-12.5 generator collects all matching templates,
//     sorts by `priority` desc, picks the highest. Ties break by
//     id. The library guarantees coverage: at least one template
//     matches every reachable context.
