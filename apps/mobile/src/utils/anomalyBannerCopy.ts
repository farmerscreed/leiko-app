// Banner copy for AnomalyBanner — Sprint 15.
//
// Pure function — produces (title, body) for a given anomaly event,
// in the recipient's voice. Voice rules apply (see docs/05); every
// string here is also run through voice-lint in the test suite to
// catch drift.
//
// The push notification body lives server-side
// (supabase/functions/_shared/notification-templates.ts); this is the
// in-app variant. They're intentionally similar but allowed to differ
// (push has 120-char limit, banner can be longer).
