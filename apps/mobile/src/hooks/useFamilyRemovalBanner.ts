// hooks/useFamilyRemovalBanner — Sprint 17b.
//
// Detects when a family the user was a member of has disappeared
// from `useFamilyReadings().parents` and surfaces a one-shot
// informational banner: "You're no longer in {label}'s circle."
//
// Why this exists:
//   - When the family_owner removes a caregiver, the caregiver
//     loses RLS access immediately. Their constellation just goes
//     empty on the next refetch with no explanation.
//   - The `family_removed` push (Sprint 17b server) is the primary
//     signal but is fragile (push permissions, quiet hours, no
//     token). This hook is the in-app safety net so the change never
//     reads as a bug.
//
// State machine:
//   1. Hook mounts; reads MMKV persisted map { familyId: label }.
//   2. On every `parents` change (post-loading), compares current
//      family_id set against persisted keys.
//   3. If any persisted familyId is missing from `parents`, that
//      family was removed → banner state goes visible with that
//      family's label.
//   4. If no disappearances, the persisted map is refreshed to
//      reflect the current set (covers the "just joined a new
//      family" + "labels changed" cases).
//   5. On `dismiss()`, the dismissed family is removed from the
//      persisted map; the banner hides.
//   6. While the banner is visible, the persisted map is NOT updated
//      — so a background → foreground cycle keeps the banner up
//      until the user acknowledges it.
